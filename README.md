## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

*   **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher (as Django 5.1 is used).
*   **pip:** Python package installer (usually comes with Python).
*   **virtualenv:** (Recommended) For creating isolated Python environments.
    ```bash
    pip install virtualenv
    ```
*   **PostgreSQL:** The database used by the project.
*   **PostGIS:** The geospatial extension for PostgreSQL. Ensure this is enabled for your database.
*   **GDAL:** Geospatial Data Abstraction Library. This is a crucial dependency for GeoDjango. Installation methods vary by operating system:
    *   **Ubuntu/Debian:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev
        ```
    *   **macOS (using Homebrew):**
        ```bash
        brew install gdal
        ```
    *   **Windows:** This can be more complex. Consider using OSGeo4W installer or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Refer to the official GDAL and GeoDjango documentation for detailed instructions.
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the Feastrove platform running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd feastrove 
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the Feastrove repository.)*

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    (Recommended to keep dependencies isolated)
    ```bash
    python -m venv env 
    # On Windows
    env\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project root (where `requirements.txt` is located) and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure PostgreSQL Database:**
    *   Ensure PostgreSQL is running.
    *   Create a new PostgreSQL database. For example, named `feastrove_db`.
    *   Enable the PostGIS extension for the newly created database:
        ```sql
        CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
        ```
        You can run this command using `psql` or a database management tool like pgAdmin.

5.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    The project uses `python-decouple` to manage sensitive settings. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory (alongside `manage.py`). Add the following environment variables to this file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials and settings:

    ```env
    SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key_here
    DEBUG=True

    # Database Configuration
    DB_NAME=feastrove_db
    DB_USER=your_db_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
    DB_HOST=localhost # Or your DB host
    DB_PORT=5432 # Or your DB port

    # Email Configuration (Example for Gmail SMTP)
    EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
    EMAIL_PORT=587
    EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email@gmail.com
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_app_password
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com

    # Google OAuth Configuration
    # These will be obtained from your Google Cloud Console
    SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS='{        "google": {            "APP": {                "client_id": "your_google_client_id",                "secret": "your_google_client_secret",                "key": ""            },            "SCOPE": ["profile", "email"],            "AUTH_PARAMS": {"access_type": "online"}        }    }'


    # PayPal Configuration
    PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id

    # Razorpay Configuration
    RZP_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
    RZP_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret

    # Exchange Rate API (if used, based on settings)
    # API_KEY=your_exchange_rate_api_key

    # Google Maps API Key
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
    ```
    **Note on GDAL for Development (Windows):**
    If you are on Windows and followed a specific local GDAL setup (like OSGeo4W or direct binary placement), ensure the GDAL paths in `feastrove/settings.py` under the `if DEBUG is True:` block are correctly pointing to your GDAL installation, or adjust your system's PATH environment variable accordingly. The provided settings attempt to configure this for a `env/Lib/site-packages/osgeo` layout.

6.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    Apply the database schema and any pending migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

7.  **Create a Superuser:**
    This will allow you to access the Django admin panel:
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to set up a username, email, and password.

8.  **Collect Static Files (Optional for Development, but good practice):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```

9.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The application should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

You should now be able to access the Feastrove platform in your browser and log in to the admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` with the superuser credentials.

## Deployment

The Feastrove platform is designed to be deployed on a production environment like AWS EC2. The typical production setup involves:

*   **WSGI Server:** Gunicorn is used to serve the Django application.
*   **Web Server/Reverse Proxy:** Nginx is used as a web server and reverse proxy to handle incoming HTTP requests, serve static files, and forward dynamic requests to Gunicorn.
*   **SSL/TLS:** Certbot is used to obtain and manage SSL/TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt, enabling HTTPS for secure communication.
*   **Database:** A production-grade PostgreSQL server with PostGIS enabled.
*   **Static & Media Files:** Typically served by Nginx or a cloud storage service like AWS S3 in a production environment.

This setup ensures a scalable, secure, and robust deployment of the Feastrove platform. Detailed deployment steps would involve configuring each of these components on the chosen server infrastructure.
